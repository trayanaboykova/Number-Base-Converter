# 🔢 Number Base Converter (Java)

A console-based **number system conversion tool** that converts numbers between **any bases from 2 to 36**, including **fractional values with controlled precision**. The application supports very large numbers, accurate rounding, and an interactive two-level menu for efficient repeated conversions.

Developed as part of my **[JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)** learning path, this project demonstrates algorithmic thinking, numerical precision, and clean CLI application design in Java.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Number Base Converter evolves step by step into a flexible and powerful conversion engine:

- **Any-to-Any Base Conversion** — Convert numbers between arbitrary bases (2–36)
- **Fractional Number Support** — Converts both integer and fractional parts
- **High Precision Arithmetic** — Uses `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`
- **Two-Level Interactive Menu** — Optimized workflow for multiple conversions
- **Precision Control** — Fractional results rounded to **5 digits**
- **Command Navigation** — `/back` and `/exit` commands supported

## 🤔 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Number-Base-Converter.git
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)
3. Run Main.java
4. Follow the prompts:
   ```bash
   Enter two numbers in format: {source base} {target base}
5. Convert numbers or use:
   ```bash
   /back   — change bases
   /exit   — quit

📈 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I built a robust numeric conversion engine, strengthened my understanding of number systems and precision arithmetic, and improved my ability to design interactive, reliable CLI applications.
